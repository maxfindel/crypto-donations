Crypto Donations
================

![usage-sample](./usage-sample.jpg)

**NOTICE: Well today June 6 2014 I got a beta invite to [Cryptiv.com](http://cryptiv.com/) and it blew my mind. They do everything I wanted to crypto-donations to do and more with their Chrome Extension.**
  
Crypto Donations is a *Chrome Extension* that enables you turn simple "code" (or syntax) into a donation button. This gives you the posibility to do micro-donations using crypto-currencies like Dogecoin in any blog or website.

An example of the syntax would be:  
\#DONATE#[DOGE]\[DP875D1fhq76trrZ9dxvt5tjQjKEB4FXVg](100)|

And if someone has the extension installed, it renders:

More information in the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crypto-donations/afkhlmigbmhkbmbgpkponijjglknggne). 

### Pending Tasks

* Add better styles
* Add local storage to store Adresses & create buttons with hotkeys
